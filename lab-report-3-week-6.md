# Stream lining ssh, Github from ieng6, copying directories

1. Stream line ssh:

![sshConfig](https://rwalsh299.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/cinfigSS.png)

This is what my Config file looks like. I had to use terminal to re-cast the file from a .txt to no extension. When I created it using the notepad it was a .txt file which will cause the machine to not read it as a config file.

Example with SCP:
![scp](https://github.com/RWalsh299/cse15l-lab-reports/workingSCP.png)


2. Setup Github Access from ieng6:

pub key on GitHub:
![pubKey](https://github.com/RWalsh299/cse15l-lab-reports/GHpubSSHKey.png)

private key stored on my machine:
![privKey](https://github.com/RWalsh299/cse15l-lab-reports/SSHPRIVKEY.png)

Pushing a change on the ieng server while logged in:
![push](https://github.com/RWalsh299/cse15l-lab-reports/gitPush on server.png)

link for that commit:

3. Copying whole directories with scp -r

I created a video which follows me copying the entire directory to the server, logging into the server, and running
the test cases in one line.
